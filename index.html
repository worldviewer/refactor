	<!-- From http://www.h3xed.com/web-and-internet/how-to-use-og-image-meta-tag-facebook-reddit
	Facebook recommends 1200 x 630 pixels for the og:image dimensions (info), which
	is an approximate aspect ratio of 1.91:1. This gives your shared post a full-size image
	above the post text. According to Facebook, you can go as low as 600 x 315 and still
	receive a full-size image, but I found that you can go as low as around 450 width. If
	you go too small (about 400 in width or less), your post will only receive a small
	square thumbnail on the left side. Also, if your image has a tall aspect ratio, Facebook
	may display a tall aspect ratio thumbnail on the left side (not square).

	A note on cropping: If you have a large image that is not in the 1.91:1 aspect ratio,
	Facebook may center and crop it to fit. If you have a small image that is not square,
	Facebook may crop it or shrink it to fit the small thumbnail size.

	Reddit uses a 70 x 70 square image for its thumbnail. Images of all sizes are resized
	down to this. Images that are wider than square will be shrunk down further to fit the
	width, while images that are taller will be cropped. Having a wide image is not good as
	it reduces the overall size of the thumbnail space that your image utilizes. Due to this,
	going with the Facebook recommendation of 1200 x 630 is bad for Reddit sharing.

	To work well on both Facebook and Reddit, be sure to make your og:image 1200 x 1200 (or
	larger) that looks good both square and cropped. Facebook will crop the top and bottom,
	while Reddit will keep it square. This gives you the largest thumbnail image on both
	sharing platforms.

	One last thing: If you do want to have the smaller square image thumbnail on Facebook, just
	make sure your og:image is smaller than 400x400 and square in aspect ratio. -->

	<!-- The Facebook SDK for JavaScript provides a rich set of client-side functionality that:

	- Enables you to use the Like Button and other Social Plugins on your site.
	- Enables you to use Facebook Login to lower the barrier for people to sign up on your site.
	- Makes it easy to call into Facebook's Graph API.
	- Launch Dialogs that let people perform various actions like sharing stories.
	- Facilitates communication when you're building a game or an app tab on Facebook.

	The SDK, social plugins and dialogs work on both desktop and mobile web browsers.

	The Facebook SDK for JavaScript doesn't have any standalone files that need to be downloaded 
	or installed, instead you simply need to include a short piece of regular JavaScript in your 
	HTML that will asynchronously load the SDK into your pages. The async load means that it does 
	not block loading other elements of your page.

	The following snippet of code will give the basic version of the SDK where the options are 
	set to their most common defaults. You should insert it directly after the opening <body> tag 
	on each page you want to load it. 

	Like Button:

See his book, <i>The Invisible Universe</i>, where he emphasizes how astronomers initially considered radio waves from space either a hoax or a mistake.  His book, <i>Interstellar Matters</i>, contains a couple of chapters which in great detail explain how to read a radio astronomy paper.  With not much more than that, Verschuur's numerous IEEE papers will become accessible to most laypeople.  His papers on interstellar HI hydrogen and critical ionization velocities (CIV's) are particularly noteworthy because they appear to suggest that ionization is an ongoing process in space -- directly contradicting what is taught to astrophysicists today.  Verschuur frequently questions the use of the term "cloud" to describe the interstellar matter structures, due to its unusually filamentary nature.  Although his publications do not directly raise the question of electricity in space (due to ongoing resistance to the idea amongst peer reviewers), it is clear to many that he is entertaining the notion.</li>

				<li data-slide="fermi-paradox">Source: <a href="http://www.holoscience.com/wp/other-stars-other-worlds-other-life/" target="_blank">Wal Thornhill's Holoscience site</a>.  From wikipedia: "The Fermi paradox — or Fermi's paradox — is the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations, such as in the Drake equation, and the lack of evidence for such civilizations."  Wal's approach would neatly explain the paradox because electromagnetic communications are commonly obstructed by plasma double layers like our own ionosphere.  In the configuration proposed, the planet would be deeply embedded within the star's electromagnetic envelope -- hence we'd struggle to observe these radio signals.  The whole idea might sound like a wacky, unsupported claim, but in fact, Dwardu Cardona has published a number of excellent books which dedicate a few thousand pages filled with references to supporting these claims.  I cannot recommend enough Dwardu's books.</li>

These are morphologies (shapes) that electricity takes when it is conducted over gas (more properly termed plasma) at extremely high charge densities.  If you look carefully at the last morphology, the central ring is the source of what is called synchrotron radiation.  Peratt explains that this would have been very dangerous radiation.  The 2d squatter man drawing appears to follow from the luminosity which results from viewing the 3d form edge-wise.</li>
